# Mission To Mars
## Additional Components 
* Added a background image to the [Bootstrap Jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/) header on the Mission To Mars homepage 
* Added the four hemisphere pictures to the Mission to Mars homepage using a [Bootstrap Card Container](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#example) for each picture
* Added a [Bootstrap Button](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/#examples) to the Mission to Mars homepage to link it to the Mars Hemispheres page
* Updated the scraping.py Python file to return Mars' fact data from the DataFrame as a list of dictionaries instead of a string representation of a html table populated with the Mars' facts
* Updated the Flask route @app.route("/") in the app.py Python file call the  @app.route("/scrape") route to generate Mars data if no data is returned from mongo. This will insure that the Mission to Mars homepage will always contain Mars information and Mars pictures
* Add a [Bootstrap Table](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/#examples) on the Mission to Mars homepage to display the Mars' fact data using this Bootstrap component instead of using the HTML table generated by the Pandas DataFrame
* Added a Mars' Hemisphers HTML page to display the four Mars' hemisphere pictures 
* Used a [Bootstrap Jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/) as the header of the Mar's Hemispher page and populated the Jumbotron's background with an background image
* Added a [Bootstrap Carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/carousel/) to the Mars' Hemisphere page to display the four Mars' hemisphere images along with information about each image isplayed in a caption at the bottom of the image. The Carousel is configured to have forward and backward arrows to allow the user to scroll though the hemisphere pictures. It is also configured with indicator controls to allow the user to select an individual hemisphere picture without scrolling though other hemisphere pictures. In addition, the Carousel is configured to rotate through the four hemisphere pictures automatically in a timed interval if no user input is detected.
* Added a [Bootstrap Button](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/#examples) to the Mars' Hemisphere page to link it back to the Mission to Mars homepage
