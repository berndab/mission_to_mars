# Mission To Mars
## Challenge Bootstrap Components Added 

* Added the four hemisphere pictures to the homepage using a [Bootstrap Card Container](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/#example) for each picture
* In each of the four Bootstrap Card Containers, added a [Bootstrap Button](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/#examples) using an HTML link tag to open and display the full image of the particular hemisphere picture in the card container
* Updated the scraping.py Python file to return Mars fact data from the DataFrame as a list of dictionaries instead of a string representation of a html table
* Add a [Bootstrap Table](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/#examples) on the homepage to display the Mars fact data
* Added a scraping results HTML page to display the results of the scraping request using a [Bootstrap Jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/) instead of plain text. 
* Added a [Bootstrap Button](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/#examples) using a HTML line on the scraping results HTML page that will return back to the homepage
